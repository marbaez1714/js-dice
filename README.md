Welcome to JS DICE created by marbaez1714 on 6-13-19. 


## Why? 
I thought it would be fun to challenge myself to a one hour code challenge. The only problem was, I didn't know what to make. So here we are... an app to help me roll lots and lots of dice for games of chance... or Warhammer 40k. 

## How? 
It's a React app. Use `npm start` to run it locally!

## Wut?
Here's what I hope to have done at the end of the hour. 

- One page React app.
- Ability to roll any number of dice (min of 20).  
- See how many of each number are rolled.
- Cooooool animations when the dice are rolled. 
- Custom dice colors
- Mobile friendly and up on Github Pages.
- A sense of pride and accomplishment. 

I am starting this challenge at 9:50pm! 

## Results! 
Update at 10:51pm.
In the spirit of the challenge and being honest, I didn't finish everything. 


Here's what I got done!
- One page React app.

Not too bad for an hour? Let's see how long it takes to get it all done. Updates to come.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
